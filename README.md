# Aerospace Engineering Analysis Tool  

## Overview  
This **Aerospace Engineering Analysis Tool** is a **Streamlit** web application designed to help engineers analyze **aerodynamic forces** and **propulsion performance** of an aircraft. The tool allows users to input various flight parameters, visualize aerodynamic properties, and calculate lift, drag, thrust, and fuel efficiency.  

## Features  
- **Aerodynamic Analysis:**  
  - Calculates **lift force** based on altitude, speed, and wing area.  
  - Computes **drag force** based on drag coefficient and atmospheric conditions.  
  - Visualizes the **lift vs. drag curve** using Matplotlib.  

- **Propulsion Analysis:**  
  - Estimates **thrust required** and **fuel burn rate** for given aircraft parameters.  
  - Allows dynamic user input to adjust key variables (speed, altitude, coefficients, etc.).  

- **Interactive Interface:**  
  - Uses **Streamlit** for a **real-time, interactive web-based experience**.  
  - Sidebar sliders to modify flight conditions and instantly update results.  

## Installation  
To run the application locally, follow these steps:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aerospace-engineering-tool.git  
cd aerospace-engineering-tool  
```  

```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

```bash  
streamlit run app.py  
```  

## Usage  
- Adjust altitude, speed, wing area, and aerodynamic coefficients using the **sidebar controls**.  
- View real-time calculations for **lift, drag, and thrust forces**.  
- Analyze **fuel efficiency and aerodynamic performance** with visual graphs.  

## Dependencies  
- **Python 3.x**  
- `streamlit`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`
